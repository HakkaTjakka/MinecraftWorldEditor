	Dual 3D Truchet Tiles
	---------------------

	This is yet another 3D Truchet example, but it consists of two unique Truchet blocks, which gives
	the pattern a bit more variation. Truchet patterns usually make use of one block, consisting
	of three strategically placed tori designed to intersect the centers of all cube faces.

	This particular pattern introduces another variation that consists of two tori intersecting four
	faces and a straight segment that runs through opposing faces. The resultant pattern has more of a
	random pipework look - as opposed to the standard snake-like one. By the way, you could save a
    lot of extra decision making and use just the second tile, but I feel the pattern lacks a little
	variance when doing that.

	Anyway, apart from some extra decision making and construction, the code doesn't differ too much
	from regular examples. By the way, I can thank Mattz for reminding me of a concept that I'd forgotten,
	which helped me speed up the distance field equation. Without it, this example would run much slower.
	I've described it briefly somewhere in among the distance field setup.

	Whilst on the subject of optimization, I should probably mention that I often take shortcuts with
	the distance field equations in order to save the GPU extra calculations. For instance, I'll use a
	bound, like "max(max(x, y), z)," for a cube instead of the correct - but usually more expensive -
	one. For the most part, you can get away with it, but things like shadows, etc, can be affected.
	IQ has an example that illustrates the point here:

	The Truchet pattern:

	A standard 3D Truchet tile consists of three toroids centered on three edges of a cube,
    positioned to enter and exit six cube faces... Look one up on the internet, and that
	diatribe will make more sense. :) The idea is to connect the tiles in a 3D grid, then
	randomly rotate each around one of the axes to produce an interesting spaghetti looking
	pattern.

	Constructing the individual tiles is as simple as breaking space into a cubic grid then
	positioning three tori in each cell. If you can position, rotate and render a torus,
	then it should be rudimentary.

	This example uses an additional block consisting of a straight tube connecting two
	opposite faces and two tori to connect the other four. That should be easy enough to
	construct too.
