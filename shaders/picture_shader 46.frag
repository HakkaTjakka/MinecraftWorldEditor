// On reducing the spatial high frequency noise:

// We simply limit the size of each contribution of each iteration of the fractal using min():
// a += i > 7 ? min( 12.,abs(length(p)-pa)) : abs(length(p)-pa)
// The test on the iteration count is optional, we found that most of the problem noise is introduced in the later
// iterations so we found that keeping the original formula for the earlier iterations helps to retain the 'volume'
// without the noise.


// On reducing the temporal noise:

// This version has volume samples aligned along view space Z isolines. When the camera moves
// forwards, the samples are shifted towards the viewer, allowing the camera to move forward
// smoothly without aliasing (besides the high frequency speckle noise).

// However if the  camera were to rotate around its origin, the volume samples towards
// the sides of the image sweep in Z and aliasing would occur. To make this case work, the samples
// need to be arranged in concentric rings around the camera. However in this configuration
// there will be some aliasing at the sides of the screen when the camera moves forward,
// because the motion of the camera can no longer be compensated for completely - one can
// pull in the vert rings but they will move at different rates in Z

// I had similar issues in a different context and made some diagrams etc, see
// http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2013/OceanShoestring_SIGGRAPH2013_Online.pptx
// And developed a fast realtime version of adaptive stationary sampling:
// https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdBXWW


// Question - the derivative can be computed for "free" using dual numbers, as in https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xd2GzR .
// The derivate may help to eliminate noise? Or perhaps the second derivate. It would be very interesting to see these
// derivatives rendered.
