rem set LEVELDIR in pacman.ini file of pacman2 to copy of levels (like ../levels2) if running 2 instances on 1 computer. Otherwise the levels are messed up. Program uses different ports so two instances can run on one computer (for testing multiplayer mode)(great fun!! You can even edit both at same time...nice for on working hours to complete mazes together with the boss:)
d:
cd \pacman\pacman2
start Pacman.exe reconnect client 127.0.0.1 tcp 40002
