This is tolua++-1.0, with changes made by the Cuberite community (*)

* What is tolua++?
  tolua++ is an extension of toLua, a tool to integrate C/C++ code with
  Lua. tolua++ includes new features oriented to c++, such as class
  templates.

  tolua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++ code 
  with Lua. Based on a "cleaned" header file, tolua automatically generates 
  the binding code to access C/C++ features from Lua. Using Lua-5.0 API and
  metamethod facilities, the current version automatically maps C/C++ 
  constants, external variables, functions, namespace, classes, and methods 
  to Lua. It also provides facilities to create Lua modules.

(*) Changes were made to make it easier to incorporate this tool into a cross-
-compiling flow. The binary stub was removed in favor of a pure-Lua
implementation by the caller.
