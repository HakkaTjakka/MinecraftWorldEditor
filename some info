For the voxel generator:

Put .obj files into dir ../models (seen from within installdir/pacman_cuberite, so installdir models).
Set pacman.ini files to right parameters. Like search paths for files. Setup list.txt files in dirs if needed.
For downloading Google 3d Earth data see the ../EARTH dir, edit some right files with the right data, see examples. Also check the file in a subdir of the javascript system for inserting a new area name.
After generating a list with code to insert into the program, (adapt some see examples, or by file like amsterdam when its large), compile it.
Download the first octant. Check the first coordinates and put them in the javascript (see examples).
Download all to obj dir, transfer to new dir, run divide.bat, run convert.bat.
Setup saves dir for minecraft files (see .bat file).
Run pacman.exe program. 
Press Backspace to select MODELS (so list.txt from ../models dir with complete filepath of .obj objects to load from, like from ../modesl itself with a dir /s/b command to generate the list.txt (see files))
Or AREA NAME from google 3d data.
Load one model / part, press Alt-B to generate .nbt files from .obj files.
Press B to generate 3d wire model of all data blocks and .dat file with size of object.
(Adapt viewer_my_loadobj.cpp function wuppie_vector with right offset settings according height of minecraft level (max 256 blocks), and/or adapt code if you want larger voxel data. (Help yourself).)

Press ctrl-6 or 6 for loading one object. lat_lon.txt for gps coords. OBJECT_ARRAY.TXT for X/Y data when loading large google maps.
Press twice ctrl-v from main window. Press 4 times shift-k. (crossing=2 mirror=4 below in screen...)
Press alt-b
The region files should now be created from the .obj files.
Msg me for installing and operating. Manual in progress.
